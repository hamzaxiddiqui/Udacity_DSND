<h1>Project Motivation</h1>
<p>
This project is for completion of Udacity Data Science Nanodegree Program and Based on Cross-Industry Standard Process of Data Mining (CRISP-DM), 
in this project the heart disease (a Health Care Problem) have analyzed and three life care questions discussed.
<ul>
<li>What is the cause of heart disease?</li>
<li>At what age do people suffer from this disease?</li>
<li>Which gender has suffering most?    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<h1>About File</h1>
<p>Repository contains two File
<ol>
<li>Jupyter Notebook (contains code) </li>
<li>A Dataset collected from <a href='https://www.kaggle.com/ronitf/heart-disease-uci'>Kaggle</a> </li>
</ol>
</p>
<h2>Python Libraries</h2>
<p>
I have used below Python Most popular and Data Science tools/libraries to complete my project
<ul>
<li>Numpy: Used for numerical manipulation with the dataset </li>
<li>Pandas: Used for manipulation like cleaning etc  </li>
<li>Matplotlib: Used for Visualization </li>
</ul>
</p>
<h1>Results of Project</h1>
<p>Result and discussion is published <a href='https://dsnd-blog.web.app/'>Here</a> </p>
<ol>
<li>Gathered the data from Kaggle name heart-disease.csv</li>
<li>Does some statistical operation with the dataset</li>
<li>applied machine learning naive bayes algorithim</li>
</ol>
<h1>Acknowledgment</h1>
<p>From the analysis of the problem i have found that,
    <ul>
    <li>The number of heart patients are Male in compare with females</li>
    <li>Mostly Heart Pateints have Non-Anginal Pain ,that is the symptom suffering from heart disease</li>
    <li>Most of the heart patient's age found in male, is in between 50-55 and in female 47-54 </li>
